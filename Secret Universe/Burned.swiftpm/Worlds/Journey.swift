As the American poet Walt Whitman wrote in the phrase \"I contain multitudes\" in his poem Song of Myself, from 1855, of course the context was different, but it fits very well for a world where the need to live in harmony with others is of major importance. \nThank you very much for playing Secret Universe developed by Gabriel Meira.").frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)

I discovered that, in the great orchestra of the biosphere, microorganisms are the true conductors, conducting the symphony of biodiversity. Every corner of this ecosystem is a stage, and interactions with the microbial world are the plots that maintain the health and vitality of each actor and actress. It's as if every corner of the biosphere has its own exciting plot full of curiosities, and I was lucky enough to be one of the tellers of a story about this spectacular microbial universe! All credits and references can be found in the README file in my playground or by searching your search for terms in the next cases.").frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
